Simple TODO list plugin for Vim, inspired by [Workflowy.com](https://workflowy.com/)

## Why?

It started with a [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/lukaszkorecki/status/175637968348917760)

Here's what was "attached":

    # vi: fen foldmethod=indent :
    * lol
      * lol
        * wat
        * wut
    +---  2 lines: * wee ------------------------------------------------------
        * meh
      * ouch

Then I started hacking on a little plugin-ish thing and came up with `workflowish`

# How?

By defining a simple syntax in Vim and using brilliant [folding capabilities](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Folding) *workflowish* can simulate 99% of *Workflowy's* features.


### Features?

- searching (Vim is pretty good at it)
- deleting (as above)
- folding and a `zoom/focus` mode
  - `zq` to focus on current item / toggle off
  - `zp` move focus to parent item
  - `za` toggles folding. See [Vim wiki: Folding](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Folding#Opening_and_closing_folds)
- notes (just add `\` in the beginning of the line to start a comment)
- [vimgrep](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/quickfix.html#:vimgrep) for filtering lines
- todos:
  - a todo which is not completed is a line which starts with `*`
  - completed todo starts with a `-`
- convert from workflowy plain text export
  - in a `.wofl` file or after `:set ft=workflowish`, run `:call workflowish#convert_from_workflowy()` to convert the whole buffer
- split windows in vim makes it easy to organize big lists

Thanks to the long running tradition, *workflowish* files have `.wofl` extension.

## Installing

[Use Tim Pope's Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

> New to Pathogen? It's easy. You "install a plugin" by putting its files in a directory. i.e. `cd ~/.vim/bundle && git clone https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/workflowish` but please, [read the Pathogen README](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).)

## Optional configuration tweak

This is not necessary for most users, but if you're a perfectionist you can do it. Add this to your .vimrc to fix [an edge-case with folding single-items](https://github.com/lukaszkorecki/workflowish/issues/5):

```
autocmd BufWinLeave *.wofl mkview
autocmd BufWinEnter *.wofl silent loadview
```
