Write a Git commit message for the given diff.

Use the style of "How to Write a Git Commit Message" by cbeams
(https://cbea.ms/git-commit/). To summarize that article:

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Try to limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the first letter of the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Try to wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

The output format should immediately start with the commit subject line, no
code fences. You can mark up inline code with backticks. You can mark up the
commit body with Markdown, e.g. `-` for bulleted lists, or fenced code samples
relevant to describing why the diff was made.

What you write will be passed directly to `git commit -m`.
